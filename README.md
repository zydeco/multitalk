# Introduction

MultiTalk is a repeater for different transports for [AppleTalk][appletalk]:
* EtherTalk, spoken by Classic MacOS or [netatalk2][netatalk] machines over Ethernet
* [LocalTalk-over-UDP][ltou] (LToU) multicast, spoken by [Mini vMac][minivmac] 37+
* TCP, spoken between multitalk instances or bbraunâ€™s `kwai` server
* [TashTalk][tashtalk], spoken by TashTalk-programmed PICs over serial
* LocalTalk over TCP, spoken between multitalk instances or [Mini vMac for iOS][minivmac4ios]
